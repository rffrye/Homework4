Code Quiz 

*********

The objective was to create a timed quiz and keep a running talley of scores based on time remaining.  The scores were stored in local storage to be renders on a separate highscore page.  The quiz proposes 6 questions to the user.  When the quiz has been initiated a time counting down from 90 secs will start.  A correct answer will advance you to the next question.  An incorrect answer will advance you to the next question and penalize you with a deduction of 10 secs from the time.  When all the questions have been answered the remaining time is your score.

*********

The code is broken down into 4 parts: 2 html files (index.html and scores.html) and 2 js files (script.js and scores.js)  They were separated into coordinating folders to keep the repository more organized. All styling attributes were added using .style in the js files.  Bootstrap was used to style all buttons and cards.
